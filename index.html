     <p style="text-align:justify;">Hsu Myat Win (Hsu), who is holding the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/internationalisation/uts-global-strategic-partnerships/opportunities-students/southern-university-science-and-technology">UTS-SUSTech scholarship</a>, has submitted her Ph.D. thesis in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au">University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)</a>. Under the guidance of <a href="https://yuleisui.github.io/">Yulei Sui</a> and <a href="https://www.shinhwei.com/">Shin Hwei Tan</a>, her research centers on Program Analysis in Android and the Automated Analysis of Unethical Behavior in Software Engineering. Prior to joining Ph.D. program, Hsu worked in the private and public sectors. This unique background equips<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> her with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical applications, enabling her to effectively integrate them in her research. One of Hsu's notable accomplishments lies in her ability to bridge the gap between academia and industry by leveraging her industry expertise and Ph.D. studies. Her hands-on experience in the industry enhances her practical skills, while her Ph.D. training fosters critical thinking and research capabilities. For instance, while employed at a company involved in developing a complex system integrating the public and private sectors, Hsu encountered difficulties in identifying the root causes of problems. This encounter served as inspiration for her Ph.D. research, leading her to develop automated debugging tools for Android applications. Her research contributions include "Event-aware precise dynamic slicing for automatic debugging of Android applications" and "Complement of Dynamic Slicing for Android Applications with Def-Use Analysis for Application Resources." In another instance, while working on a project that entailed providing data reports on a biannual basis, Hsu faced a client concern regarding ethical issues. This experience motivated her to create a tool capable of detecting unethical behavior in open-source software projects. Her research output in this area is encapsulated in the publication titled "Automatic Detecting Unethical Behavior in Open-source Software Projects." Hsu also has teaching experience, where she engages students by using real-world examples in tutorials. For instance, she teaches the concept of "Scope of Requirement" by using the familiar "Buying food" example, emphasizing the importance of understanding customer needs before product development. As an online Teaching Assistant, she overcomes technical and participation challenges by providing GitHub backups for materials, enabling Live Chatting for prompt feedback, and using project progress charts to boost student engagement. Hsu's teaching approach combines practicality with innovation, making her an effective educator.</span><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">[Read more...]</button></p>
